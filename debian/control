Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 Zetacoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system with 
 fast conformations that is completely decentralized, without the need 
 for a central server or trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys 
 to their own money and transact directly with each other, with the 
 help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.
 .
 Full transaction history is stored locally at each client.  This
 requires 2+ GB of space, slowly growing.
 .
 This package provides zetacoind, a combined daemon and CLI tool to
 interact with the daemon.
